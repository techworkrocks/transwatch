This Android app downloads all newly shot images from your **Transcend Wifi SD** card on the fly ("**Shoot and Download**").

This App specifically addresses the issue that the original app from Transcend only allows a "Shoot and View", but not an automatic download.

TransWatch automatically connects to the SD card, once it is connected to the Wifi. It listens for new images and automatically downloads them into a configurable destination folder.

An installable apk can be found within this project's repository in /trunk/TransWatcher/builds
